## Description

cpp_modules is a C++ short piscine divided into different exercises. These exercises are designed to cover various aspects of C++ and OOP programming and provide hands-on experience with different concepts.

## Features

- Structured exercises covering fundamental C++ concepts
- Hands-on practice with C++ syntax and programming constructs
- Incremental learning approach with progressively challenging tasks
- Introduction to Object Oriented Programing
- Designed as a short piscine to enhance C++ proficiency

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of C++ programming language
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- Make

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/cpp_modules.git
    ```
2. Access the cloned directory
    ```bash
    cd cpp_modules
    ```
3. Explore and complete the exercises to enhance your C++ skills.

## Usage
