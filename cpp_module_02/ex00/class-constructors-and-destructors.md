The class Fixed is an example of a class that implements a fixed-point representation with some member functions and the necessary special member functions. Let me explain each of the concepts you mentioned:

1. Default Constructor:<br>
    A default constructor is a constructor that is called when an object is created without any arguments. In your class, the default constructor is Fixed::Fixed(void). It initializes _fixedPointValue to 0.

2. Copy Constructor:<br>
    A copy constructor is called when a new object is created as a copy of an existing object. In your class, the copy constructor is Fixed::Fixed(const Fixed &src). It initializes a new object using the values of an existing object.

3. Copy Assignment Operator Overload:<br>
    The copy assignment operator (operator=) is used when an already initialized object is assigned a new value from another object. In your class, the copy assignment operator is Fixed &Fixed::operator=(const Fixed &rhs). It assigns the value of rhs to the current object and returns a reference to it.

4. Destructor:<br>
    The destructor is a special member function that is called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. In your class, the destructor is Fixed::~Fixed(void). It is responsible for any cleanup or resource deallocation. In your case, it prints a message but doesn't perform any actual cleanup.

5. Other Member Functions:<br>
    int getRawBits(void) const: This member function returns the raw value of the fixed-point value.
    void setRawBits(int const raw): This member function sets the raw value of the fixed-point value.

It's worth noting that your copy constructor implementation is currently using the assignment operator (*this = src). While it works, a more common and efficient practice is to directly initialize the members in the initialization list of the copy constructor.

Here's an example:

```cpp
d::Fixed(const Fixed &src) : _fixedPointValue(src.getRawBits()) {
    std::cout << "Copy constructor called" << std::endl;
}
```

This directly initializes _fixedPointValue with the raw bits of the source object, avoiding an extra assignment.
